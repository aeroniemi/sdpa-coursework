    "The core dataset for this project - the user's streaming history - can be downloaded from the Spotify Account/Privacy page ([here](https://www.spotify.com/uk/account/privacy/)). It'll take a while to arrive, but when it does you'll have a folder containing a whole host of json files. Of interest for this project are those named ``StreamingHistory[x].json`` - these contain:\n",
    "- Artist Name - The name of the Artist\n",
    "- Song Name - The name of the song\n",
    "- endTime - Timestamp that the song finished playing at, ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM``\n",
    "- msPlayed - Amount of the song that was played in milliseconds\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple files, named from 0 through [n], split up to ease reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "In and of itself this data is interesting, but it can be combined with spotify's catalog to allow for more advanced analysis. The Catalog contains a wide variety of datapoints about each song, including its BPM, dancability, valence and energy. We'll use these traits later to assess my listening habits.\n",
