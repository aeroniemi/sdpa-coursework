# Data Analytics
The goal, or should I say the Dream, is to ~~build a colony~~ assess my musical tastes

To do this, I will:
- Download the list of spotify songs that i've listened to in the last year
- Link that to the details about each song using the spotify api in py
- Ask some questions

## My questions
- Do I listen to different songs in different scenarios?
-
